# Github Spring Cleaning 2024

I wanted a way to "scrub" and consolidate my older repositories on GitHub because my prior practices made things a bit disjointed.  Going forward I might practice this act again if things become unsightly and are seemingly of low personal impact.

## Your Commits Are Gone!

Yes, unfortunately the log of my commits disappear when I delete my personal repositories.  It's frustrating, as ultimately it was a nice tracker of my progress.  But ultimately, these programs (etc.) are mostly archival by this state.  I will not be going back to alter most of their states.  They were created to explore and learn, and they have done their dues.

## Organization

I have organized projects into sub-folders which are nested under a singular parent topic.  Anything not fitting into a singular subject have been moved a miscellaneous folder.  Please feel free to click around and explore the various folders.  Some project examples are hosted with links listed in their individual readmes.

* [React](https://github.com/jodoesgit/Spring-Cleaning-2024/tree/main/React 'react-18')
* [HTML CSS Javascript](https://github.com/jodoesgit/Spring-Cleaning-2024/tree/main/Html-Css-JS 'html-css-js')
* [Etc.](https://github.com/jodoesgit/Spring-Cleaning-2024/tree/main/Etc. 'etcetera')

## Future Commits

Any future commitments are because I have walked back to continue my studies on the subject.  I have found that following anything in a particularly straight line doesn't seem to fulfill my largest needs when it comes to learning.  So I might just leave these as purely archival and continue onwards with newer ideas, subjects, and projects overall.
