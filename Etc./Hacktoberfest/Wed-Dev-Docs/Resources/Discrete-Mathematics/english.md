## Introduction

Discrete Mathematics seek finite solutions to practical problems. This branch of mathematics is 
grounded in common real-world issues and is the basis of computer science.  Applications include 
explorations of logic, probability, counting, number theory, recurrence, and graph theory.  These 
act as the proof or logic behind programs.  Both optimizing them and returning desired results.

## Logic

Procedural expressions of facts or rules performed in an explicit manner.

## Induction-and-Recursion

Methods to calculate proofs through applied logic.  Induction is finite, iterating from a base step until the initial statement is proven true.  Recursion is performed successively, calling upon itself infinitely until the defined base case is met.

## Number-Theory

The study of all natural numbers and integers, algebraically explored.  Used to develop algorithms, data structures, cryptographic keys, and solve calculations.

## Counting

A way to calculate explicit boundaries within a set system.  Also useful when scaling a system, object, or application to those results.  Building and sustaining processes in structured ways by setting finite limitations.

## Graphs

Data structures that connect elements to display relationships and solve problems.  There are many 
different types of graphs, as well as many different ways to solve them.  Such as mapping and routing 
data.  As well as expressly communicating performance or displaying models.

## Probability

A quantifiable assessment between the relation of cost and risk.  This aids in the execution, 
reliability, and growth of all applications and tools.  By analyzing data, charting outcomes,
 and making changes predictively towards desired results.
