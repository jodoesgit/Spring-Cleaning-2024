## Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest 2023 marks its 10th anniversary. A collaborative online event encouraging individuals of all levels of experience to contribute to open source projects. Participation requires registration on the official website - [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/).  [Registration](https://hacktoberfest.com/auth/) opens on September 26th, and extends until October 31st. Contributions can be made from October 1st to October 31st as four or more accepted pull/merge requests. Individuals may contribute to any open source codebase found on [GitHub](https://github.com/topics/hacktoberfest) & [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/explore/projects/topics/hacktoberfest?utm_campaign=devrel&utm_budget=devrel) marked for "hacktoberfest."

There are many [Beginner's Resources](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#beginner-resources) to explore. As well as external guides, such as [How to Use Git & Github](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/introduction-to-git-and-github/) from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news). There are also a series of low/no-code contributions that can be made for first-timers such as the ones found on [first issue](https://www.firstissue.dev/). These issues can include design work, translation skills, social media coverage, writing (technical/copy), & code contributions. [Hacktoberfest projects](https://finder.usmans.me/) cover many different languages, uses, and requirements. Be patient, find the right project for you, and make sure to read any specific guidelines placed by the project owner.

## General

My draft pull requests donâ€™t seem to be counting toward Hacktoberfest. Whatâ€™s going on?

_For Hacktoberfest, pull requests on GitHub will not be counted until they are marked as ready for review: those marked as draft will not be counted. Please make sure to relabel any draft PRs as ready for review so that project maintainers can merge them._

___


Why is my pull request in a maturing state on my profile?

_In an effort to reduce spam and help maintainers, weâ€™ve introduced a one-week review period for all pull requests. Once you have submitted four eligible PRs (ready-to-review, not drafts), the seven-day review window begins. This period gives maintainers time to identify and label any spammy PRs as invalid. If your PRs are not marked invalid during that window, they will allow you to complete the Hacktoberfest challenge. If during this period any of your PRs are labeled as invalid, you will return to the pending state until you have four eligible PRs, at which point the review period will start again._

___

How do I get started?

_First, register at [hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). Then, submit at least four PRs to any public GitHub repository. You can look for open issues labeled Hacktoberfest for inspiration. Quality contributions are encouraged!_

_Are you maintaining a repo? Create issues or label existing ones with Hacktoberfest on your GitHub projects to help new contributors know what to work on. Tag any spam or irrelevant PRs with the invalid label to disqualify them._

___

My pull request is marked as being on an excluded repository. What does this mean?

_Unfortunately, your pull request was made on a repository that doesnâ€™t align with the core values of Hacktoberfest. Weâ€™ve decided that pull requests made to this repository will not count toward completing the challenge._

___

My PR was labeled as invalid, but it isnâ€™t. What should I do?

_If a maintainer labels your pull request as invalid, but you donâ€™t believe this is correct, please begin a conversation with the maintainer within the PR and explain your position._

___

How do I track my progress?

_Log in with your GitHub account at [hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) to check your progress and stats._

___

What is Hacktoberfest?

_Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean and DEV._

_Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community.
To participate, four pull requests must be submitted to public GitHub repositories.
You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31._

___

As a maintainer, how do I encourage contributions to my repos?

_Create issues for anything youâ€™d like contributors to help with, making sure to give them a Hacktoberfest label so theyâ€™re easier to discover._

_You can also share issues or repositories on Twitter, using [#Hacktoberfest](https://twitter.com/hashtag/hacktoberfest) where weâ€™ll retweet as many as we can for contributors to see._

___

What happens if I complete fewer than four PRs by the end of the month?

_Unfortunately, you will have to submit at least four PRs to get a T-shirt._

___

As a maintainer, how should I handle spam PRs?

_We donâ€™t like seeing spam PRs just as much as you, so please give them an invalid label and close them. PRs with an invalid label wonâ€™t be counted toward Hacktoberfest._

How do I get stickers?

_Stickers are included with your T-shirt after completing four PRs._

____

My pull request was labeled as invalid by a maintainer, why doesnâ€™t it count?

_If a repository maintainer decides a pull request you made was spammy or an unhelpful contribution to the project, they can add an invalid label to your PR. This lets us know they do not think your pull request is a quality contribution, so it will not count toward Hacktoberfest._

___

I completed four PRs. When will I receive my T-shirt?

_T-shirts will be awarded on a first-come, first-serve basis to the first 50,000 participants who successfully complete the Hacktoberfest challenge. Weâ€™ll start sending out emails with more details on redeeming T-shirts throughout the month, so stay tuned._

### Rules
Do issues/commits count?

_No, only PRs count._

___

Do multiple PRs to the same repo count?

_Yes, each pull request will count separately._

___

Do PRs have to be accepted/merged?

_No, they will still count unless they are spam, irrelevant, or labeled as invalid._

___

Can I make PRs to issues/repos that are not listed on the homepage?

_Yes, any public GitHub repo is good for Hacktoberfest._

___


I signed up for Hacktoberfest mid-October. Will PRs that I created earlier in October count?

_Yes, all pull requests created between Oct. 1 and Oct. 31 will count, regardless of when you register for Hacktoberfest. Pull requests created before Oct. 1 but merged after do not count._

___

Do issues have to be labeled Hacktoberfest to count?

_No, any pull request made on a public repository counts, whether itâ€™s attached to a Hacktoberfest issue or not._

___

Do PRs made on my own repos count?

_Yes, but we strongly encourage you to make quality contributions to other repositories._

___

Do contributions made outside of GitHub count?

_No, PRs must be made on the GitHub platform._
